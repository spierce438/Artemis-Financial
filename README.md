# Artemis-Financial

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is an investing company that deals with peoples retirement money and other financial functions. The most important thing for them was to check authenticty using files and of course as always the security of the user in all aspects of the company.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I had a very rough time with this project. It is tough to put all of these different subjects together without having any errors. The errors that I had seemed to come from some issue when I opened the project originally. I always have trouble opening the project because mine will never open properly. I am not sure what the issue is as to why this keeps happening, but I'll open the project in the same way over and over and then eventually it opens properly. It is so important to have secure code because of the fact that hackers will look for unsecure code to take advantage of and steal information. The value of software security is endless because of the fact that one hack can cost a company up to billions of dollars.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The vulnerability assessment is helpful, but I feel it is very easy for me to think that every thing is a vulerability that needs to be prioritized.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Layers of security are added by the multiple security checks like the checksum and dependency checks and adding the server to verify authenticity is very important too.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
The code was made secure checking for errors and correcting until their were none and using the secondary testing and functional testing.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I like to use youtube tutorials in order to get step by step instructions. It is very helpful for the quick access to a good almost hands on learning tool when I have trouble.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show my future employer that I have learned how to run different checks in order to test my code for the top security. I will also show that I know how to correct code and identify issues while writing good clear clean code.
